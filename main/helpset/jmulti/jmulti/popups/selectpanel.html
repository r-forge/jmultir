    <h2>
      Select Panel
    </h2>
    <p>
      The select panel appears whenever variables should be
      selected from the set of available series. By clicking the
      RIGHT mouse button over the selected time series, a popup
      menu appears. Depending on the modelling context it is
      sometimes only possible to select one endogenous variable.
      The select panel computes the data matrices to be used in the
      procedures. It operates according to the following rules:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Every selection has to be finished with the
        CONFIRM SELECTION button (variables, order, and range).
      </li>
      <li>
        The order of the selection is taken into account and can be
        checked in the list. The variable that has been selected
        first appears on the top.
      </li>
      <li>
        Only series with the same frequency can be selected
        together.
      </li>
      <li>
        Only series with overlapping time ranges can be selected
        together. The start and end dates adjust automatically if
        the selected range does not match. The longest possible
        range can be set via clicking the MAX button.
      </li>
    </ul>
