    <h2>Transform Dialog</h2>

    <p>The transform dialog allows to do the most common transform
    operations on the set of selected time series. The
    transformation results in new series which are added to the
    time series list with a descriptive suffix, indicating the type
    of the transformation.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>If LOGARITHM is selected, then
      the natural logarithm of the series is taken. An error
      message is generated if there are values <code>&lt;=0</code>
      in the series to transform.</li>

      <li>LEVEL means that no differences are taken.
      Seasonal differences are not possible with series that have
      frequency 1.</li>

      <li>A difference transformation together with the logarithm
      results in differences of logarithms of the original
      series.</li>

      <li>If LEVEL is selected and the LOGARITHM is not checked, then
      nothing is done.</li>
    </ul>
