      Time Series Calculator
    </h2>
    <p>
      The <i>TS Calculator</i> can be used to create new variables
      by combining existing ones with arithmetic expressions. It
      provides the simple language <i>TSCalc</i> that operates with
      one dimensional arrays and scalars. Examples are:<br>
      <br>
       <code>newvar = invest + cons;</code><br>
       <code>invest(-1) = lagn(invest,-1);</code><br>
       <code>invest_std = stand(invest);</code><br>
       <code>z = rndn(100);</code><br>
       <code>z;</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      The code that was used for the generation of new series is
      used as a description of new variables. This description can
      be accessed via the SHOW DESCRIPTION item from the popup menu
      over the time series in the <a href=
      "popups/selectpanel.html">selector</a>. This way it is possible to
      keep the information on how a set of series was created.
    </p>
    <p>
      The operation is as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        First select the variables to be used in the selector. The
        names appear in the list AVAILABLE VARIABLES and are put
        into the variable space of the calculator.
      </li>
      <li>
        Write one or more commands to the command area an execute
        them with EXECUTE or <code>Ctrl+E</code>. Newly created
        variables appear in the list of available variables.
      </li>
      <li>
        Finally add the selected variables in AVAILABLE VARIABLES
        to the workspace with ADD SELECTED.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Variable names must start with a non digit and may contain
      letters, digits and '_'. They are case insensitive. Define a
      new variable with <code>newvariable = some expression
      ;</code>. One can execute several commands at once by
      separating them with <code>;</code>. If a variable should be
      printed to the output window, just write
      <code>variablename;</code>. All array operations are applied
      element wise. <i>TSCalc</i> understands exponential notation,
      e.g. <code>1.234e-3</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following functions are implemented, where <i>a, b</i>
      are always a one dimensional arrays, e.g. a variable name,
      and <i>c</i> is a scalar:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
        max(a,b) - takes 2 vectors of same dimension and returns
        vector with max elements
      </li>
      <li>
        min(a,b) - takes 2 vectors of same dimension and returns
        vector with min elements
      </li>
      <li>
        log(a)
      </li>
      <li>
        lagn(a,c) - lags vector a by c periods and fills missings
        with NaN values
      </li>
	  <li>
	  	fracdiff(a,c) - fractional differencing operator (Hosking 1981)
	  </li>
      <li>
        stdc(a) - returns std. deviation of vector a
      </li>
      <li>
        meanc(a) - returns mean of vector a
      </li>
      <li>
        stand(a) - standardizes vector a by subtracting the mean
        and dividing by its std. deviation
      </li>
      <li>
        reverse(a) - reverses the order of a given vector, starting
        from observation T to 1
      </li>
      <li>
        rndn(c) - generates a c x 1 vector of random variables
        between 0 and 1
      </li>
      <li>
        ones(c) - generates a c x 1 vector of ones
      </li>
      <li>
        trend(c) - generates a c x 1 trend vector starting from 1
        to c
      </li>
      <li>
        rows(a)
      </li>
      <li>
        sqrt(a)
      </li>
	   <li>
        sin(a)
      </li>
      <li>
        cos(a)
      </li>
      <li>
        tan(a)
      </li>

    </ul>
    <p>
      By double clicking on a variable in the list, the name
      appears in the command window and can be combined with
      commands from the calculator. In case there are syntax
      errors, a descriptive message is printed to the output
      window. One should correct the error and simply try again. If
      the selection in the time series selector is changed, the
      workspace of the calculator is overwritten. Variables that
      have not been added to the workspace before are lost.
