      Create Dummy Dialog
    </h2>
    <p>
      This dialog allows to build shift and impulse dummy
      variables. The selected variable defines the sample range of
      the new dummy variable.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        One can select the timing of the shift/impulse by editing
        the respective text fields. The selected range/date is then
        set to the value 1, all other values to 0.
      </li>
      <li>
        NAME OF NEW SERIES is the name of the created
        time series in the time series list. One should make sure
        that the name does not already exist, otherwise a dialog
        will ask to overwrite the existing series.
      </li>
      <li>
        The created dummy series is automatically marked with the
        <i>deterministic</i> property.
      </li>
    </ul>
