          <p>
            Project management in JMulTi makes it possible to store
            data, output, and the model settings for each module in
            a single file. This way it is possible to restore the
            state of an analysis conveniently. JMulTi project files
            are in an XML format with the suffix <code>.jsc</code>.
            Projects that have previously been loaded and the
            currently loaded project appear in the explorer panel.
            This allows to switch quickly between them by a double
            click.
          </p>

            Open and Save
          </h3>
          <p>
            After a project has been loaded, it appears in the
            explorer panel tagged with the <img src=
            "../images/currentproject.gif"> symbol. To open a
            project there are different possibilities:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              drag and drop project files to the explorer bar
            </li>
            <li>
              use the <img src="../images/openproject.gif"> button
              from the FILE menu or the toolbar
            </li>
            <li>
              double click on an existing project in the explorer
              bar
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            To save the current state of the analysis to a project
            file, the SAVE AS button <img src=
            "../images/saveprojectas.gif"> should be used. A
            configure dialog will appear.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is also possible to save the analysis to an already
            existing project with its RIGHT mouse popup and the
            SAVE CURRENT STATE HERE option.
          </p>

            Configuring Projects

          <p>
            The project configuration dialog appears when the SAVE
            AS button is pressed or when the EDIT item is selected
            from a projects RIGHT mouse popup. Adjustable settings:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>project name:</b> the project appears in the
              explorer panel with that name, it does not have to be
              unique
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>file:</b> the file to which the project is stored,
              it always gets the suffix <code>.jsc</code> even if
              not specified, if a file is chosen that already
              belongs to another project, that other project will
              be removed from the explorer panel and is overwritten
              with the new project
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>project description:</b> an optional description
              for the project
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>data description:</b> an optional description for
              the data that is stored with a project, there might
              be different data types in the future, currently only
              <i>Time Series Data</i> is available, the default
              entry are the data descriptions of all imported
              series

          <p>
            All recently opened projects appear in the explorer
            bar. This should make it very easy to switch between
            different analyses. Elements from this list can be
            deleted by selecting them and pressing the DEL button
            or by using the RIGHT mouse popup menu. New projects
            can be put to the list and are instantly loaded via
            drag and drop.
