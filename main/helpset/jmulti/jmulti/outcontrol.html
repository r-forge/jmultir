            Output Control
          </h2>
          <p>
            The symbol for the output control is <img src=
            "../images/outcontrol_b.gif">. This system allows to
            log all output that is generated during the analysis in
            a single place. All output entries can be ordered
            according to name or time. Time ordering reflects the
            single steps of an analysis, whereas name ordering
            allows to group results from similar procedures.
          </p>
          <p>
            The output entries in the output control frame can be
            selected and the content of all selected elements
            appears in the text display to the right, from where it
            can be saved to a file. This makes it easy to gather
            all relevant output for saving.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because output accumulates very quickly, the logging
            can also be disabled via the toggle button OUTPUT
            HISTORY on top of the explorer panel. The symbol will
            then change to <img src="../images/outcontroloff.gif">.
            No output elements will be added in this state.
          </p>
          <p>
            When a project is saved, all elements that are
            currently in the output control are stored as part this
            project and are restored when that project is loaded.
            This also means that all  output elements are replaced by
            the projects output when it is loaded. Therefore, the
            accumulated output should be saved to an external file
            or as part of the current project before a new project
            is loaded.
