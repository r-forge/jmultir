            About JMulTi (www.jmulti.com)
          </h3>JMulTi is a JAVA interface to various Gauss procedures
          for econometric analysis. It is not necessary to have Gauss
          installed to run JMulTi because the Gauss Runtime Engine is
          used which is shipped with the program. JMulTi was created
          with the JStatCom software framework, see www.jstatcom.com.
