            Description
          </h3>
          <p>
            Almost all variables and intermediate output from
            computations in JMulTi can be accessed via the CONTROL
            -&gt; SYMBOL CONTROL menu, or via the toolbar. The icon
            is <img src="../images/scontrol.gif" width="16"
               height="16">. The symbol control can be considered
               as an expert system that shows additional
               information to the user.
          </p>
          <p>
            Variables always belong to a certain module. This is
            visualized by the tree structure from which symbols can
            be selected. Modules and child components appear by
            their name. Each symbol is associated with an icon that
            reflects its type. If a treenode is disabled, then the
            corresponding symbol is empty.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are <i>global</i> variables which are shown
            directly under the respective module node. Usually
            these symbols contain the variables that define a
            model.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are also <i>local</i> symbols only visible to the
            respective panel they are defined in. They can be found
            in child nodes of the top-level module nodes. Local
            symbols often contain results from specific
            calculations that do not need to be accessed by other
            components for further computations, for example test
            results.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most symbols contain a description of their contents.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Exporting Data
          </h3>
          <p>
            It is possible to export NARRAY and SARRAY symbols to
            data files. For NARRAYs different file formats are
            possible, see <a href="impdata.html">import data</a>
            for a description of them. This feature can be used to
            store intermediate results and to use them with other
            software packages. Output formatting can be adjusted
            for NARRAYs which only has effect if the DAT format is
            used. Via a RIGHT mouse click on the data table, the
            precision and the display type can be changed. However,
            this does not affect how data is exported.
