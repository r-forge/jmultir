            JMulTi stores program specific settings in the XML file
            <code>$HOME/.jmulti_settings</code>. This file is read
            when the program starts and it is overwritten when
            JMulTi finishes. The information contains user
            specified settings, size and position of the main
            frame, and other state information.

            The behaviour of JMulTi can be adjusted via FILE -&gt;
            PREFERENCES. The preferences dialog presents a table
            where the values can be changed by clicking on it.

              <b>save/restore last state</b>: whether the last
              state should be saved when the program finishes and
              loaded when it starts, this is disabled when this
              property is <code>false</code>.

            By default, JMulTi saves the state of the current
            analysis in the file
            <code>$HOME/.jmulti_laststate</code> when the program
            is quit. This project is then automatically loaded at
            program start, making it convenient to continue an
            analysis. The project LAST STATE appears in the
            explorer panel with the date when it was created. This
            feature can also be disabled via the user preferences.
            Unlike other projects, the LAST STATE project cannot be
            edited.
