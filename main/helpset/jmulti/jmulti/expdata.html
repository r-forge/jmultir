          <p>
            Data export can be used to interchange data between
            different programs. It is possible to export any series
            that appears in the time series list to a data file. To
            do this, one should select one or more series, click
            the RIGHT mouse button, and press SAVE DATA TO FILE.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is not only possible to save time series data, but
            also the state of the current analysis along with the
            data. This is handled by the <a href="pm.html">project
            management</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not only time series, but any data that is stored
            internally by JMulTi can be exported to a file. See the
            <a href="varcontrol.html">symbol control</a> section
            for more on this.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Data Format<a name="DAT"></a>
          </h3>
          <p>
            The exported series are saved in the format that
            corresponds to the selected file filter. All supported
            data formats are listed there. See the <a href=
            "impdata.html">import</a> section for a description of
            them. If the default file filter is used, data is
            stored in the JMulTi DAT format.
