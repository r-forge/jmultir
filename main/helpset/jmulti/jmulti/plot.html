            Most plots in JMulTi are generated by the Gauss Runtime
            Engine. The features for viewing graphs and exporting them
            to different file formats are predetermined by the
            graphics viewer provided by Aptech. If this does not give
            acceptable results, it is often possible to export the
            relevant data from the <a href="varcontrol.html">symbol
            control</a> to a file, and use the data with a different
            software for plotting.
          </p>
          <p>
            All plots in JMulTi can be configured via the CONTROL
            -&gt; GAUSS PLOT CONFIGURATION menu. The configuration
            dialog allows to adjust various general plot settings
            for Gauss plots. Not all settings are taken into
            account by all plots, for example there is not always a
            legend available, even if SHOW LEGEND is checked.
          </p>
          <p>
            The plot configuration can be used to hide titles,
            legends and axes names. They can later be replaced with
            an external graphics kit, or with the help of the LaTeX
            <i>overpic</i> environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sometimes there are more detailled options available
            that are specific to a certain plot in a given context.
            If available these settings overwrite the global plot
            settings.
