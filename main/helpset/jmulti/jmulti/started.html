            An analysis usually starts with importing a dataset or
            opening an existing project. This can be done via
            <a href="dragndrop.html">drag and drop</a> over the
            explorer panel to the left, or via the <code>File</code>
            menu. Previously used projects appear in the explorer
            panel as well until they are removed from there by the
            user.

            Many components offer access to useful functionality if
            the RIGHT mouse button is clicked over it, for example
            projects, time series, data tables, and text
            components.

            Also from the explorer panel one can choose the model
            frame that should be applied. Each module is described
            in a separate help chapter. The context-sensitive help
            button can be used to get quick access to the help
            topic belonging to a certain component by clicking over
            it.
