          A project contains all the time series that are
          visible in the time series list. To save a project, go to
          the <code>File-&gt;Save as Project</code> menu item and
          select a file. The default suffix is <code>.jsc</code>
          (JStatCom). No further interaction is necessary. The file
          is in binary format and cannot be opened with another
          program. To export datasets to ASCII format check <a
